<p align="right">		CHIEF ELECTORAL OFFICER

----

1. Nominee hxllcatzz was disqualified from public office for a period of twelve (12) months due to a violation of ยง61.

2. Section 61 states, "An individual or organisation must not, **purport to nominate an individual for an election without authority to do so**."

3. The nominee violated this section by nominating anonymouscoconut12 after they had already nominated themselves.

### **APPEAL**

4. The nominee appealed this decision.

5. The nominee argued that: <br/>
  a) The time he nominated himself was late (12am), and, <br/>
  b) the electoral commission should have notified him of the false nomination. 

6. The Chief Electoral Officer rejected argument (a) on the basis that: <br/>
  a) The Electoral Commission was not at fault for the registration at the late hour, and that, <br/>
  b) the nominee has sufficient time to correct their error (almost 23 hours).

7. The Chief Electoral Officer rejected argument (b) on the basis that: <br/>
  a) The Electoral Commission was not at fault for the nomination being incorrect, and that, <br/>
  b) the nominee was not contacted by the commission because it may have been seen as special treatment or courtesy that was not extended to any other candidates.

8. This appeal was then **DENIED**.

9. The nominee began to lash out at the Chief Electoral Officer, swearing and threatning their life.

10. The nominee's disqualification was upgraded to last permanently.

**Mr. Hxllcatz is hereby issued a permanent Disqualification from Public Office, this day, the 16th of April 2025.**
