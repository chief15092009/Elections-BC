### 2. Appeal

2.1. The nominee submitted a formal appeal of the disqualification.

2.2. The grounds of appeal were as follows: <br/>
   a) That the nominee’s self-nomination occurred late (at 12:00 AM), and  <br/>
   b) That the Electoral Commission should have notified him of the invalid nomination.

2.3. The Chief Electoral Officer rejected argument (a) on the basis that: <br/>
   a) The Electoral Commission is not responsible for the timing of a nomination; and  <br/>
   b) The nominee had approximately 23 hours remaining to amend the invalid nomination.

2.4. The Chief Electoral Officer rejected argument (b) on the basis that: <br/>
   a) The Electoral Commission is not responsible for identifying or notifying candidates of invalid nominations; and   <br/>
   b) Any such notification could have constituted special treatment not afforded to other nominees.

2.5. Accordingly, the appeal was **denied in full**.
